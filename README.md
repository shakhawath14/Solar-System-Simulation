# Solar-System-Simulation

Welcome to our Solar System Simulation project! Here, we utilized the power of Pygame and OpenGL to create an immersive 2D simulation of our solar system. Pygame, a versatile Python package for game development, coupled with OpenGL's capabilities for 3D graphics, enabled us to bring the celestial bodies of our solar system to life on your screen.

## Project Features:
- Solar System Simulation: Experience the orbits and rotations of the Sun and four planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) in a visually captivating environment.

- Interactive Gameplay: Control with arrow keys, navigating through the simulated solar system amidst randomly generated stars.

- Efficient Algorithms: Leveraging algorithms such as the midpoint circle algorithm for drawing planets and Bresenham's algorithm for triangles ensures smooth rendering and efficient performance.

## Implementation Details:
- Technologies Used: Python 3.7, Pygame 2.0.1, OpenGL 3.3.

- Organized Structure: Modularized functions handle various aspects of the simulation, from drawing celestial bodies to managing user interaction.

- Frame Rate Control: A clock mechanism ensures a consistent frame rate of 60 frames per second, enhancing the simulation's fluidity.

## Future Scope:
- Educational Tool: Extend the project to include more celestial bodies like moons, asteroids, and additional planets, serving as an educational resource for students learning about astronomy.

- Enhanced Visualization: Continuously improve visual elements, such as adding textures and enhancing planetary details, for a more immersive experience.

## Contributions:
We welcome contributions from developers interested in enhancing the simulation, adding features, or optimizing performance. Join us in exploring the cosmos through code!
